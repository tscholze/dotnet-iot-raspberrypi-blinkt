# üåà .NET IoT Raspberry Pi Blinkt! ‚ú®

Welcome to an illuminating journey with your Raspberry Pi! This project brings the vibrant [Pimoroni Blinkt!](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/blinkt) LED board to life using C# and .NET, transforming your Pi into a colorful playground of lights and coding creativity.

## üöÄ What Does It Do?

With this lively .NET IoT implementation, you can:

- üé® Set individual LED colors to express your mood or data
- üåà Create mesmerizing rainbow effects
- üí° Control LED brightness for just the right ambiance

Whether you're a hobbyist, a student, or a seasoned developer, this project is the perfect way to learn about hardware control and have some fun with lights!

## üîå Hardware Requirements
